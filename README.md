# MITbadbank2023
This is code for a banking app in React.  There is no security so that's why it's bad.

##React Project
This is my first large-scale React project.  There are some good things; but other things which need improvement.  This project helped me become familiar with React and app structure.  I can then use that knowledge to build future React projects.

##Installation
Fork then download the respository.  Open its contents in VS Code and initiate npm install, then node index.js.  This was built with React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.

##Future Plans
In the future, I hope to get everything working properly.  Right now, the app is a skeleton with a few added features.

##License
This app uses the MIT License.
